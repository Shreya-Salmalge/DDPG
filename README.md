  <li> In Policy Gradient algorithms, policy is represented by a parametric probability distribution that stochastically selects action a in state s according to parameter vector Î¸.
  <li> In our project we instead consider deterministic policies.
  <li> In the deterministic case it only integrates over the state space, so computing the stochastic policy gradient may require more samples.
  <li> In order to explore the full state and action space, a stochastic policy is often necessary. To ensure that the deterministic policy gradient algorithms continue to explore satisfactorily, an off-policy actor-critic algorithm was used.
